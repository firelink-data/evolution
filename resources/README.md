## Common resources

The [template_schema.json](./template_schema.json) is the template that all evolution schemas have to follow.
An example file that follows this template can be seen in the [example_schema.json](./example_schema.json) file,
which is also available to see in the README at the root of the project.

The [schemas/](./schemas) directory contains schema files used during testing (**these should not be used for any production use-cases**).
